    <div class="intro-griditem"><h2>Sri Lankan Turtle population</h2>
        <p>Today there are 250 species of turtles on earth. Seven of these live in the ocean and are called sea turtles.
           The remaining 243 species live on land or in freshwater ponds and marshes. The terrestrial turtles, those that live solely on land, are called tortoises.
           Five of the seven species of sea turtles in the world visit the shores of Sri Lanka to breed. 
           They are the Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas), Hawksbill Turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), Olive Ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea), Loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and Leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea).
           The sea turtles are called Kesbawa in Sinhala and Amai in Tamil.
           There are three species of freshwater turtles and one terrestrial tortoise in Sri Lanka.
           The freshwater turtles are Parkerâ€™s Black Turtle (Melanochelys trijuga pakeri) Sri Lanka Black Turtle (Melanochelys trijuga thermalis) and the Soft or Flapshell turtle (Lissemys punctata punctata). 
           The terrestrial tortoise is the Star tortoise (Geochelone elegans).

        <p> The green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), also known as the green turtle, black (sea) turtle or Pacific green turtle, is a species of large sea turtle of the family Cheloniidae. 
            It is the only species in the genus Chelonia. Its range extends throughout tropical and subtropical seas around the world, with two distinct populations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, 
            but it is also found in the Indian Ocean. The common name refers to the usually green fat found beneath its carapace, not to the color of its carapace, which is olive to black.
            The dorsoventrally flattened body of C. mydas is covered by a large, teardrop-shaped carapace; it has a pair of large, paddle-like flippers. <a class="tutlink" href="turtles.html#greenturtlep3">more.</a>

            It is the only extant species in the genus Eretmochelys. The species has a global distribution, that is largely limited to tropical and subtropical marine and estuary ecosystems.
            The hawksbill's appearance is similar to that of other marine turtles. <a class="tutlink" href="turtles.html#hawksbillturtlep3">more.</a>

            The species is the second-smallest and most abundant of all sea turtles found in the world. L. olivacea is found in warm and tropical waters, primarily in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, but also in the warm waters of the Atlantic Ocean.
            This turtle and the related Kemp's ridley turtle are best known for their unique synchronised mass nestings called arribadas, where thousands of females come together on the same beach to lay eggs.<a class="tutlink" href="turtles.html#oliveRidleyturtlep3">more.</a>

        <p> The loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) is a species of oceanic turtle distributed throughout the world. It is a marine reptile, belonging to the family Cheloniidae. 
            The average loggerhead measures around 90 cm (35 in) in carapace length when fully grown. The adult loggerhead sea turtle weighs approximately 135 kg (298 lb), with the largest specimens weighing in at more than 450 kg (1,000 lb). 
            The skin ranges from yellow to brown in color, and the shell is typically reddish brown. No external differences in sex are seen until the turtle becomes an adult, the most obvious difference being the adult males have thicker tails and shorter plastrons (lower shells) than the females.
            The loggerhead sea turtle is found in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, as well as the Mediterranean Sea. It spends most of its life in saltwater and estuarine habitats, with females briefly coming ashore to lay eggs. <a class="tutlink" href="turtles.html#Loggerheadturtlep3">more.</a>

            It is the only living species in the genus Dermochelys and family Dermochelyidae. It can easily be differentiated from other modern sea turtles by its lack of a bony shell; instead, its carapace is covered by oily flesh and flexible, leather-like skin, for which it is named. <a class="tutlink" href="turtles.html#Leatherbackturtlep3">more.</a>

        <h3>Turtles return to nest on Colomboâ€™s shores in rare event</h3>
        <p id="tutinn">By Kasun Warakapitiya <br> 

            Olive Ridley turtles have been coming ashore at a stretch of naturally formed beach near Galle Face to lay eggs.
            
            The Open Universityâ€™s senior zoology lecturer, Dr Saminda Fernando, said the sighting of the species, Lepidochelys olivacea, had dropped during the construction of the port city when sand was dredged.
            
            But now a natural sandy area has formed near the area where the Beira Lake opens up to the sea.
            
            Dr. Fernando said it was surprising that egg-laying Olive Ridley turtles had returned as they do not usually come to areas that are illuminated. In contrast, beaches at Kosgoda and Hikkaduwa are free from illumination

        <h3>Marine turtles get a second chance while nets still pose risks</h3>
        <p id="tutinn">By Malaka Rodrigo <br>

            Abandoned fishing gear in Sri Lankan waters continue to pose dangers to marine turtles, and there is little help on shore for creatures that are seriously injured. The bycatch remains problematic.
            
            But, in nearby Maldives, a group is helping to rescue and rehabilitate injured marine turtles.
            
            Three types of fishing gear have been identified as risks to sea turtles â€” gill nets, prawn/shrimp trawls, and longlines. Gill nets account for the highest number of entanglements. There are instances where fishermen themselves cut the flippers to protect their nets
